Here’s a detailed analysis of the Round Robin (RR) Scheduling code, with a breakdown of each section and the algorithm used.

Code Analysis
Class: Process
This class defines attributes and represents each process with:

processID: Unique identifier for the process.
arrival: Time when the process arrives in the system.
burst: Burst time (execution time) required by the process.
remainingTime: Remaining burst time as the process executes in quantum intervals.
waiting: Total waiting time in the ready queue.
turnAround: Turnaround time from arrival to completion.
finish: A flag indicating whether the process has finished (1 if complete, 0 if not).
completionTime: Actual time when the process completes execution.
Main Class: RRScheduling
The main class simulates the RR scheduling algorithm, taking user input, calculating each process's completion time, waiting time, and turnaround time, then computing the average metrics.

Initialization
Input Parameters:
The number of processes (n).
Each process’s arrival and burst times.
Quantum: Time slice allocated to each process in a single round.
Initialize Variables:
sumBurst: Total burst time across all processes, used to control the main execution loop.
avgWAT and avgTAT: Average waiting and turnaround times, calculated at the end.
Sorting Processes by Arrival Time
The code sorts processes based on their arrival times to handle the first-arrived process first.

Main Loop for Round Robin Execution
Queue Setup: A queue (q) tracks the processes that are ready to execute.
Loop Execution:
The loop continues until all processes have completed (i.e., when total burst time is reached).
Process Selection: The next process (p[i]) is dequeued.
Time Quantum Check:
If remainingTime of p[i] is less than or equal to the quantum, the process completes in this round.
Update Metrics: Update completionTime, waiting, and turnAround for p[i].
Add to Queue: Processes arriving before or during the current time are added to the queue if they aren’t already completed or in the queue.
Otherwise, the process executes for the quantum, and remainingTime is reduced by the quantum.
Add Back: Process p[i] is re-added to the queue if it hasn’t completed.
Add New Arrivals: Any other processes arriving during this interval are added to the queue if not already included.
Calculation of Waiting and Turnaround Times
After completion:

Turnaround Time (TAT): completionTime - arrival for each process.
Waiting Time (WAT): TAT - burst.
Display and Output
The program displays:

Each process’s ID, arrival time, burst time, completion time, turnaround time, and waiting time.
Average Waiting Time and Average Turnaround Time for all processes.
RR Scheduling Algorithm Explanation
Round Robin Scheduling is a preemptive algorithm where each process is given a time quantum (slice of CPU time). If the process completes within this quantum, it finishes; otherwise, it goes back to the queue.
Process Execution Order:
Processes are enqueued in the order of their arrival.
Each process executes for either the full quantum or its remaining burst time.
Queue Management:
Processes not completing in a quantum are re-added to the queue.
New processes arriving during execution are also added to the queue.
Sample Output Walkthrough
Given sample input data, the output will show each process's calculated metrics:

Processor, Arrival time, Burst time, Completion time, Turnaround time, Waiting time for each process.
Average Turnaround Time and Average Waiting Time calculated across all processes.
