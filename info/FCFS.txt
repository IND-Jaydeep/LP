This Java program implements the First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) scheduling algorithm. Iâ€™ll break down each section of the code, explaining the purpose, data structures, and logic in detail.

Code Breakdown
Importing Libraries:

java
Copy code
import java.util.*;
Imports the java.util package, which includes the Scanner class. This class is used for taking input from the user.
Class Declaration:

java
Copy code
public class FCFS {
Declares the FCFS class, which contains the main method and the entire program logic for FCFS scheduling.
Main Method:

java
Copy code
public static void main(String[] args) {
The main method is the entry point of the program.
Variable Initialization:

java
Copy code
Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
int n;
float avgtat = 0, avgwt = 0;
sc is a Scanner object for user input.
n is the number of processes.
avgtat and avgwt store the average Turnaround Time (TAT) and Waiting Time (WT), respectively.
User Input for Number of Processes:

java
Copy code
System.out.println("*** First Come First Serve Scheduling ***");
System.out.print("Enter Number of Process: ");
n = sc.nextInt();
Prompts the user to enter the number of processes and assigns this value to n.
Data Structures for Process Information:

java
Copy code
String process[] = new String[n];
int arrivaltime[] = new int[n];
int burstTime[] = new int[n];
int TAT[] = new int[n];
int waitingTime[] = new int[n];
int completionTime[] = new int[n];
Arrays for each process characteristic:
process[]: Stores process names (like P1, P2, etc.).
arrivaltime[]: Stores the arrival time of each process.
burstTime[]: Stores burst times, or the time required by each process to complete.
TAT[]: Stores Turnaround Times for each process (completion time - arrival time).
waitingTime[]: Stores Waiting Times for each process (TAT - burst time).
completionTime[]: Stores Completion Times for each process (cumulative total time to complete each process).
Input for Arrival and Burst Times:

java
Copy code
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    process[i] = "P" + (i + 1);
    System.out.print("Enter Arrival Time for processor " + (i + 1) + ":");
    arrivaltime[i] = sc.nextInt();
    System.out.print("Enter Burst Time for processor " + (i + 1) + ": ");
    burstTime[i] = sc.nextInt();
}
Populates the process, arrivaltime, and burstTime arrays based on user input for each process.
Calculation of Completion Times:

java
Copy code
completionTime[0] = burstTime[0];
for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
    completionTime[i + 1] = completionTime[i] + burstTime[i + 1];
}
Sets completionTime[0] as burstTime[0], meaning the first process completes as soon as its burst time elapses.
For subsequent processes, calculates each process's completion time by adding the current process's burst time to the previous process's completion time.
Output Table Header:

java
Copy code
System.out.println("*** First Come First Serve Scheduling ***");
System.out.println("Processor\tArrival time\tBurst time\tCompletion Time\t\tTurn around time\tWaiting time");
System.out.println("----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------");
Prints a formatted table header for displaying process details.
Calculating Turnaround Time (TAT) and Waiting Time (WT):

java
Copy code
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    TAT[i] = completionTime[i] - arrivaltime[i];
    waitingTime[i] = TAT[i] - burstTime[i];
    avgtat += TAT[i];
    avgwt += waitingTime[i];
Calculates TAT as completionTime[i] - arrivaltime[i] for each process.
Calculates waitingTime as TAT[i] - burstTime[i] for each process.
Accumulates avgtat and avgwt to later calculate average TAT and WT.
Displaying Results for Each Process:

java
Copy code
System.out.println(process[i] + "\t\t" + arrivaltime[i] + "ms\t\t" + burstTime[i] + "ms\t\t" + completionTime[i] + "ms\t\t\t" + TAT[i] + "ms\t\t\t" + waitingTime[i] + "ms");
For each process, prints the arrival time, burst time, completion time, TAT, and WT.
Calculating and Printing Average TAT and WT:

java
Copy code
System.out.println("Average turn around time of processor: " + (avgtat / n) + "ms\nAverage waiting time of processor: " + (avgwt / n) + "ms");
Calculates and displays the average TAT and WT by dividing the accumulated values by the number of processes.
Algorithm Explanation
Initialization: Initialize arrays to hold process details and declare variables for averages.

Process Input: Take input for arrival and burst times for each process.

Completion Time Calculation:

For the first process, set completion time equal to burst time.
For each subsequent process, add the current burst time to the previous completion time.
Turnaround and Waiting Time Calculation:

Calculate TAT and WT for each process based on completion, arrival, and burst times.
Display and Averages:

Print the calculated values and compute the average TAT and WT.
This code provides a clear implementation of the FCFS scheduling algorithm, which schedules processes based on their arrival order.
