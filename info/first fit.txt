This Java program demonstrates the First-Fit Memory Allocation Algorithm. In this memory allocation method, processes are allocated to the first available memory block that is large enough to accommodate them.

Code Analysis
Importing Libraries

java
Copy code
import java.util.Scanner;
The Scanner class is used to take input from the user.
Class Declaration and firstFit Method

java
Copy code
public class FirstFit {
Defines the main class FirstFit, which contains the firstFit method and the main method.
The firstFit Method

java
Copy code
static void firstFit(int blockSize[], int m, int processSize[], int n, int remblockSize[])
This method executes the core First-Fit algorithm.
Parameters:
blockSize[]: Array containing the sizes of each memory block.
m: Number of memory blocks.
processSize[]: Array containing sizes of each process.
n: Number of processes.
remblockSize[]: Array for storing the remaining size of each block after allocation.
Initialization of allocation Array

java
Copy code
int allocation[] = new int[n];
for (int i = 0; i < allocation.length; i++) {
    allocation[i] = -1;
}
The allocation[] array tracks which block each process is assigned to.
Initially, all values in allocation[] are set to -1, indicating that no process has been allocated.
Outer Loop: Iterating Over Each Process

java
Copy code
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
This loop iterates through each process in processSize[] to attempt allocation.
Inner Loop: Finding the First Available Block

java
Copy code
for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
    if (blockSize[j] >= processSize[i]) {
        allocation[i] = j;
        blockSize[j] -= processSize[i];
        remblockSize[i] = blockSize[j];
        break;
    }
}
For each process, this loop iterates over all memory blocks.
Logic:
if (blockSize[j] >= processSize[i]): Checks if block j has enough space for process i.
allocation[i] = j: Assigns the first suitable block (block j) to the process.
blockSize[j] -= processSize[i]: Reduces the size of block j by the size of the process.
remblockSize[i] = blockSize[j]: Stores the remaining size of block j after allocation.
break;: Exits the inner loop after finding the first fitting block, as per the First-Fit approach.
Printing Allocation Results

java
Copy code
System.out.println("\nProcess No.\tProcess Size\tBlock no.\tRemaining Block Size");
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    System.out.print(" " + (i + 1) + "\t\t" + processSize[i] + "\t\t");
    if (allocation[i] != -1) {
        System.out.print((allocation[i] + 1) + "\t\t" + remblockSize[i]);
    } else {
        System.out.print("Not Allocated" + "\t" + remblockSize[i]);
    }
    System.out.println();
}
This section prints the results of the memory allocation for each process.
Output Fields:
Process No.: Identifier for each process.
Process Size: Size of each process.
Block no.: The memory block to which the process is allocated (or "Not Allocated" if no suitable block is found).
Remaining Block Size: Shows the remaining size in each block after allocation.
main Method

java
Copy code
public static void main(String[] args) {
    int m, n, num;
    Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
The main method takes user input for memory block and process details.
User Input for Block Sizes

java
Copy code
for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
    System.out.print("Enter Data " + (i + 1) + ":");
    num = in.nextInt();
    blockSize[i] = num;
}
Takes user input for the sizes of each memory block.
User Input for Process Sizes

java
Copy code
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    System.out.print("Enter Data " + (i + 1) + ":");
    num = in.nextInt();
    processSize[i] = num;
}
Takes user input for the sizes of each process.
Calling the firstFit Method

java
Copy code
firstFit(blockSize, m, processSize, n, remblockSize);
Executes the firstFit method to perform the memory allocation.
Algorithm Summary
Initialize an empty allocation[] array to keep track of assigned blocks.
For each process, scan each memory block to find the first block with sufficient space.
If a suitable block is found, allocate the block to the process, update the block's remaining size, and record it in remblockSize[].
Print the allocation results to display which block (if any) each process was allocated and the remaining block size.
Data Structures Used
Arrays:
blockSize[]: Stores the initial sizes of memory blocks.
processSize[]: Stores sizes of each process.
allocation[]: Tracks which block each process is allocated to.
remblockSize[]: Stores the remaining size of each block after allocation.
Key Difference from Best-Fit Algorithm
First-Fit: Allocates the first block that can accommodate the process.
Best-Fit: Searches all blocks to find the smallest block that can fit the process, aiming to minimize wasted space.
This First-Fit approach is straightforward and often faster than Best-Fit, as it stops searching after finding the first fitting block, making it efficient for cases where speed is a priority over optimal space utilization.
