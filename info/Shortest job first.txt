Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of the code, including a breakdown of each part, and the algorithmic steps followed for implementing Shortest Job First (SJF) Scheduling in a preemptive mode.

Code Breakdown and Explanation
Package and Class Setup

java
Copy code
import java.util.*;
public class SJF  
Imports the java.util.* package, which includes utility classes, particularly Scanner for input.
Defines the main class SJF, representing the Shortest Job First scheduling algorithm.
Main Method

java
Copy code
public static void main (String args[])
The program's entry point. All scheduling logic and computations are implemented here.
Variable Declarations and Inputs

java
Copy code
Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
System.out.println("*** Shortest Job First Scheduling (Preemptive) ***");
System.out.print("Enter no of process:");
int n = sc.nextInt();
Initializes Scanner for user input.
Takes the number of processes n from the user.
Arrays and Variables for Process Data

java
Copy code
String process[] = new String[n];
int arrivaltime[] = new int[n];
int burstTime[] = new int[n];
int completionTime[] = new int[n];
int TAT[] = new int[n];
int waitingTime[] = new int[n];
int flag[] = new int[n];
int remburstTime[] = new int[n];
Arrays to store:
process[]: Process IDs.
arrivaltime[]: Arrival times for each process.
burstTime[]: Burst times (total time each process takes).
completionTime[]: Times when each process completes execution.
TAT[]: Turnaround times for each process.
waitingTime[]: Waiting times for each process.
flag[]: Marks a process as completed or not.
remburstTime[]: Remaining burst times, to handle the preemption.
Additional Counters and Summation Variables

java
Copy code
int st = 0, tot = 0;
float avgwt = 0, avgta = 0;
st tracks the current system time.
tot counts the total number of completed processes.
avgwt and avgta will hold total waiting and turnaround times to calculate averages later.
Input Loop for Arrival and Burst Times

java
Copy code
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    process[i] = "P" + (i+1);
    System.out.print("Enter Arrival Time for processor " + (i+1) + ":");
    arrivaltime[i] = sc.nextInt();
    System.out.print("Enter Burst Time for processor " + (i+1) + ": ");
    burstTime[i] = sc.nextInt();
    remburstTime[i] = burstTime[i];
    flag[i] = 0;
}
Loops through each process to gather:
Arrival time.
Burst time.
Sets remburstTime[i] to the burst time as initial remaining burst time.
Sets flag[i] to 0 indicating each process is initially incomplete.
SJF Scheduling Logic (Preemptive)

java
Copy code
while(true){
    int min = 99, c = n;
    if (tot == n) { break; }
Continues until all processes (tot == n) are complete.
min is initialized to a high value (99) to find the shortest burst time in each loop.
c holds the index of the selected process to execute.
Process Selection and Preemption Logic

java
Copy code
for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if ((arrivaltime[i] <= st) && (flag[i] == 0) && (burstTime[i] < min)) {
        min = burstTime[i];
        c = i;
    }
}
Finds the process with:
Arrival time <= current system time st.
Incomplete status (flag[i] == 0).
Minimum remaining burst time.
If such a process is found, c stores its index.
Execution and Completion Check

java
Copy code
if (c == n) { 
    st++; 
} else { 
    burstTime[c]--; 
    st++; 
    if (burstTime[c] == 0) { 
        completionTime[c] = st;
        flag[c] = 1;
        tot++;
    }
}
If no process is ready (c == n), it increments the system time.
Otherwise:
Decreases burstTime[c] by 1 unit (preemptive execution).
Updates system time.
If burstTime[c] reaches 0, it sets completionTime[c] to the current time, marks the process as complete (flag[c] = 1), and increments tot.
Calculating Turnaround and Waiting Times

java
Copy code
for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    TAT[i] = completionTime[i] - arrivaltime[i];
    waitingTime[i] = TAT[i] - remburstTime[i];
    avgwt += waitingTime[i];
    avgta += TAT[i];
}
Computes TAT[i] (Turnaround Time) as the time difference between completionTime and arrivalTime.
Calculates waitingTime[i] by subtracting the initial burst time from TAT[i].
Adds waitingTime[i] and TAT[i] to avgwt and avgta for average calculation later.
Output Display

java
Copy code
System.out.println("Processor\tArrival time\tBrust time\tCompletion Time\t\tTurn around time\tWaiting time");
for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    System.out.println(process[i] + "\t\t" + arrivaltime[i] + "ms\t\t" + remburstTime[i] + "ms\t\t" + completionTime[i] + "ms\t\t" + TAT[i] + "ms\t\t" + waitingTime[i] + "ms");
}
System.out.println("\nAverage turn around time is " + (float)(avgta/n));
System.out.println("Average waiting time is " + (float)(avgwt/n));
Displays the process details including arrival time, burst time, completion time, turnaround time, and waiting time.
Prints average turnaround and waiting times.
Algorithm Summary
Input Phase: Collects the arrival and burst times for each process.
Loop:
Finds the process with the shortest remaining burst time, that has arrived and is incomplete.
Executes it for one unit of time, updating burst and completion times as necessary.
Marks a process as complete when its burst time becomes zero.
Output Phase: Calculates and displays turnaround and waiting times, including their averages.
